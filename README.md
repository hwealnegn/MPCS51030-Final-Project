# MPCS51030-Final-Project
This is my final project for iOS Application Development (Winter 2015) in the Masters Program in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

Align is a time zone converting app that allows users to not just coordinate times of locations, but assign names of people to locations, allowing for an enhanced time-zone-converting experience.
